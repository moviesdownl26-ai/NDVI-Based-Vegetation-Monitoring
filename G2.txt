# NDVI-Based Vegetation Analysis of Karnataka

## 📌 Overview
This project analyzes vegetation density across Karnataka, India, using the 
Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) derived from Sentinel-2 satellite imagery.
The analysis is performed using Google Earth Engine and visualized through an
interactive Streamlit web dashboard.

## 🎯 Objectives
- Assess spatial variation of vegetation density across Karnataka
- Classify land cover into vegetation density categories using NDVI
- Provide interactive geospatial visualization through a web-based dashboard

## 🛰️ Data Source
- **Satellite:** Sentinel-2 (ESA)
- **Year of Analysis:** 2024
- **Platform:** Google Earth Engine

## 🛠 Tools & Technologies
- Google Earth Engine (cloud-based geospatial processing)
- Python
- geemap
- Streamlit
- ngrok (for web deployment)

## 🌍 Interactive Dashboard
The project includes a Streamlit-based interactive dashboard for visualizing NDVI
and vegetation classification maps.
